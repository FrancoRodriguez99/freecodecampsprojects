       <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

       <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>

        <code>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</code>

        <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. </p>
        <p>All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>

        <p>The Diner's success was so big, a company decided buy it and open a franchise around it. Hanry and William sold it, seeing a whole lot of profit coming from it, but there was a catch: the company used sneaky legal actions that allowed them to have the diner 100% under their possession, erasing Henry's and Michael's name from it. The company then opened Fazbear's Entertainment to take care of everything.</p>

<p>William was so pissed because of this he cut any relationship with anyone involved with the franchise. Henry, on the other hand, didn't know any other thing to do, so he asked for a job; he became Phone Guy.</p>

<code>FFP opened in 1973, and featured four furry suits of animals: Freddy Fazbear, a recolour of Bonnie, Chica and Foxy The Pirate. This made William even more pissed when he learnt they made four animatronics without him. He started planning his revenge.

        <p>In 1976 William had twins: a little blonde girl and a little brunette boy. He started to teach Michael to take care of them, because "Daddy won't be around forever".</p>

<p>During his free time, William started designing and projecting new robots (he hated the name "animatronics") and plans for his own company: Afton Robotics. But he had another plan under his sleeve: ruin FFP from the inside.</p>

<code>He disguised himself as Dave Miller and started working applied for day time security guard at FFP. As he was always wearing purple - the uniform's colour - and usually hid in the shadows to stay out of sight of anyone who might recognize him, he was nicknamed by every child as "The Purple Guy".</code>

<p>During this time, in 1980, he did his evil plan: using the Spring Bonnie suit he built years earlier, he lured five children to a back room, murdered them and hid inside the body of the animatronics. In case you're wondering what he did with the fifth one, he obviously hid it inside a spare Freddy suit he then painted yellow, duh.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Billy, they actually caught Henry instead of him, as one of the cameras caught him walking around in one of the suits. He got out sometime later, as they managed to prove he had some mental disabilities and had a fixation with wearing the suits around, and had no violent behaviour.</p>

<code>But Dave? Well, he was fired when FFP closed.</code>
